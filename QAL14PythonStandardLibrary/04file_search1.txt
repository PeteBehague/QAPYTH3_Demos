egrep is an acronym for "Extended Global Regular Expressions Print".
It is a program which scans a specified file line by line, returning lines that contain a pattern matching a given regular expression.
The standard egrep command looks like:

egrep <flags> '<regular expression>' <filename>

Some common flags are:
-c for counting the number of successful matches and not printing the actual matches,
-i to make the search case insensitive,
-n to print the line number before each match printout,
-v to take the complement of the regular expression (i.e. return the lines which don't match),
-l to print the filenames of files with lines which match the expression.

Regular expressions come in their own egrep variant (this is very similar to the regular expressions found in emacs, perl, etc.)
